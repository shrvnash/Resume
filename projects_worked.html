        <p><b>Role: </b>Associate Quality Engineer</p>
        <p><b>Description: </b></p>
        <p>Mitogen Genetics 7.0 is a web based application which used to track and create reports for analysis of cancer related diseases.<br>
        It processes the variants using vcf files and provides the variant details of the same which is reviewed by the geneticist.<br>
        The application tracks the different patient cases using various statuses such as Draft, Final Review, Final, Amendment, Amendment<br>
        Final when the final review is done it is sent to the lab.</p>

        <p><b>Project #3</b></p>
        <p><b>Title: </b>Mitogen Genetics 6.2 and 6.3(FAST and Lab)</p>
        <p><b>Technologies: </b>MTM, TFS.</p>
        <p><b>Role: </b>Quality Engineer</p>
        <p><b>Description: </b></p>
        <p>Filtration, Annotation, and Storage Tool (FAST) is a tool for managing, annotating and filtering large data sets from tests such as large panels,<br>
          exomes, and genomes. The system facilitates the determination of which variants from a case are the most clinically relevant and will ultimately be<br>
          reported. A laboratory can load both sample (patient) data and annotation (external information from publicly and privately available databases) data<br>
          into FAST. The sample and annotation data are then combined to allow systematic curation and filtering of the identified variants. The laboratory can<br>
          filter this data using saved filters and/or ad hoc filters for searching. Once the laboratory has identified the final set of variants for reporting,<br>
          they are either downloaded or sent to Sunquest Mitogenâ„¢ Genetics Lab for reporting. Lab 6.2 is designed to assist you in drafting molecular diagnostic<br>
          test reports. It also assists in tracking data used as input in the report generation process. Reports generated by Mitogen genetics Lab must be reviewed<br>
          and approved for accuracy by experienced, trained and properly credentialed medical personnel prior to release for clinical use.
